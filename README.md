# packagist-api-client

Packgist (PHP Package Repository) API client in JavaScript.

## Docs

You'll find the docs at https://moonmeister.github.io/packagist-api-client

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or PRs with any problems you find. I have no way of being notified if Packagist changes their API, so if something breaks due to a change on Packagist open an issue and I'll see what I can do.
